## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When an svg is embedded in an `<img>`-tag, you can not change color by adjusting the `fill` but you need to use `filter`.
I'm also feeling a lot more comfortable using positioning since last exercise. 

### Useful resources

- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - This helped me making the typography fluid to fix the issue with the long word 'extraordinary' on smartphone-view. This way it was easy to use a `clamp`-value. I used it on both `h1` and `h2`.
